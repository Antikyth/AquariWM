AquariWM is a fully modular window manager, allowing extreme extensibility while accommodating all
users, from newcomers to seasoned experts.

## Installation
AquariWM is currently in early development and has yet to have a public release.  You can clone the
repository and build the code locally if you wish to contribute or test that which has been
completed so far.


## How does AquariWM compare to other window managers?

### Universal communication
Most other window managers only allow configuration through a limited selection of formats or
languages, typically just one.  AquariWM, on the other hand, communicates with modules (and
therefore configuration too) through a universal method of communication, supported by nearly every
single programming language, called Inter Process Communication (IPC for short) sockets.  You are
free to use whatever language and/or way of communicating with the window manager you prefer.

### Use it your way
Due to AquariWM's modular approach, there's no limit to the features you can use.  If something
you'd like to do doesn't exist, make it!  You could even release it as a module under the AquariWM
GitHub organization if you would like, or you could distribute it separately (or even just use it
yourself!) - the choice is yours.

### Complete documentation and extensive guides
AquariWM guarantees that all features and all APIs are fully and thoroughly documented before they
can be merged with the development branch, and that guides have been written for all features
before they can move from the development branch to main.  Everything you need to know is available
to read.

### A welcoming community
We believe community is one of the most important aspects of any project, and that's why we strive
to create a friendly and welcoming community for all, regardless of your level of experience and
free from discrimination, bigotry, arguments, or disrespect.  The AquariWM community is a place to
share tips, suggestions, and friendly discussions in general.

### However...
However, please keep in mind that AquariWM is still a small project.  AquariWM is in early
development, and may not yet provide the full experience of more established window managers.  If
you would like to help us change that, why not contribute to the project - we're always looking to
improve what we have, and everything - big or small, even if this is your first time contributing -
is welcomed and appreciated.  I can't wait to see what AquariWM can become!

## Modules
Unfortunately, there are no modules available for AquariWM at this time.

## Contributing
Contributions are greatly appreciated!  Please, do feel free to contribute.  A proper contributors'
information page will be added in the future.
