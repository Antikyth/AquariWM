Any language, any level of experience, fully extensible. It's time for a tiling window manager
*everyone* can use.

AquariWM focuses on four key pillars: accessibility, extensibility, documentation, and
open for everyone.

## Installation
AquariWM is currently in development and does not have a public release yet. You can clone the
GitHub repository and build the code locally if you would like to test it and/or contribute.

## Why should I use AquariWM?
Most other window managers can only be configured one way. They either have one type of config
file, meaning that they are too simple to customize extensively, or they use one programming
language, meaning that they are too complicated for beginners and don't let people use their
preferred language. AquariWM can use any method of configuration and any programming language
through its use of IPC sockets.

Unlike some other window managers, AquariWM recognises that not everyone wants to use their
computer the same way. AquariWM provides complete and official support for common features, even if
they aren't used by its developers.

AquariWM has complete documentation and guides. Anything you want to do will be there, and if it
isn't, please make an issue in the Issues tab; we consider that a bug.

## Extensions for AquariWM
All extensions to AquariWM communicate through IPC sockets.

### Layouts
AquariWM has no layouts available at this time.

### API Wrappers
AquariWM has no dedicated APIs available for specific languages at this time. Communication can
still happen directly through the IPC sockets.

## Contributing
Contributions to AquariWM are always appreciated! AquariWM's core is written in Rust and uses
Rust's official style guides. All feature or API contributions to AquariWM **must** be accompanied
by complete documentation. You can learn more in CONTRIBUTING.md. Feel free to ask any questions
you might have in the Discussions tab.
